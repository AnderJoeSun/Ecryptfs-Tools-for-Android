Since Android is build on top of the Linux kernel, EFS-Tools library and executables can be easily ported to any Android device independently of the AOSP version. However, there is a small demo of EFS-Tools library, which requires graphicall interface. For this to work you must download and build the  Android 4.4_r1.2 (kitkat) tree.
